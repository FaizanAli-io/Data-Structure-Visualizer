# Data-Structure-Visualizer

## Description:

The Data Structure Visualizer is an educational tool developed in C++ to aid in understanding complex data structures through visual representation. This project offers an intuitive interface for visualizing fundamental data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, binary trees, and graphs. By providing step-by-step visualizations of operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal, the tool helps users grasp the underlying mechanics of these structures. The visualizer is equipped with customizable options, allowing users to input different values and observe how the data structures evolve with each operation.

Key features include:

    Interactive Visualizations: Users can interact with the visualizer to see real-time changes as they perform various operations.
    
    Algorithm Demonstration: The tool demonstrates common algorithms like sorting and searching, making it an excellent resource for students and educators.
    
    User-friendly Interface: Designed with a focus on simplicity, the interface is easy to navigate, ensuring a smooth learning experience.
    
    Performance Analysis: Users can observe the performance implications of different data structures and algorithms, gaining insights into efficiency and optimization.

This project is a comprehensive learning aid for anyone looking to deepen their understanding of data structures and their practical applications.

## To run the project:

1. Install SFML 2.6.1 + MinGW32 (add to path)
2. Place the SFML 'include' and 'lib' folders in a folder named 'src'
3. Place all the .dll files found in the bin folder into a folder named 'run'
4. Run the command 'make' from the command line (cmd, terminal, powershell)
